Small module that allows you to get the fs constants across Node and the browser.


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install fs-constants
\end{DoxyCode}


Previously you would use `require(\textquotesingle{}constants'){\ttfamily for this in node but that has been deprecated and changed to}require(\textquotesingle{}fs\textquotesingle{}).constants\`{} which does not browserify.

This module uses `require(\textquotesingle{}constants'){\ttfamily in the browser and}require(\textquotesingle{}fs\textquotesingle{}).constants\`{} in node to work around this

\subsection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var constants = require('fs-constants')

console.log('constants:', constants)
\end{DoxyCode}
