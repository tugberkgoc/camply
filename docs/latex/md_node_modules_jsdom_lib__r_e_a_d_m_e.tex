We\textquotesingle{}re slowly moving from a historical model based on layered \char`\"{}levels\char`\"{} of specs, to the \href{https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_does_.22Living_Standard.22_mean.3F}{\tt living standard model} actually implemented by browsers. As such, the code is kind of a mess.

{\bfseries Summary}\+: new features go in {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/living} and follow the code style there; modifications to existing features will require some spelunking to find out what to modify in-\/place. 



A lot of the main implementation is in {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/level1} and {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/level2}. (That includes things that didn\textquotesingle{}t appear in the original D\+OM Level 1 and Level 2 specs, just because the code was located there and we had to patch it.) We\textquotesingle{}re trying to avoid adding new code there, but patching old code is often still required.

New features generally go in the {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/living} folder, in nice small files, with a clear coding style enforced by E\+S\+Lint and J\+S\+CS.

We\textquotesingle{}re planning to fix this whole situation with a multi-\/stage process\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item First, consolidate any leftovers in {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/browser} and {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/level3}, as well as the more substantial body of code in {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/level2}, into {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/level1}. This will contain the \char`\"{}historical\char`\"{} portion of the jsdom codebase.
\item Then, embark on a major cleanup and refactoring effort, splitting out small pieces from {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/level1} and into {\ttfamily lib/jsdom/living}, cleaning up the code style and spec compliance as we go.
\item Finally, collapse the silly directory hierarchy into something less nested.
