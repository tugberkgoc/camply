A node module that calls a callback when a readable/writable/duplex stream has completed or failed.

npm install end-\/of-\/stream

\subsection*{Usage}

Simply pass a stream and a callback to the {\ttfamily eos}. Both legacy streams, streams2 and stream3 are supported.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var eos = require('end-of-stream');

eos(readableStream, function(err) \{
  // this will be set to the stream instance
  if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
  console.log('stream has ended', this === readableStream);
\});

eos(writableStream, function(err) \{
  if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
  console.log('stream has finished', this === writableStream);
\});

eos(duplexStream, function(err) \{
  if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
  console.log('stream has ended and finished', this === duplexStream);
\});

eos(duplexStream, \{readable:false\}, function(err) \{
  if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
  console.log('stream has finished but might still be readable');
\});

eos(duplexStream, \{writable:false\}, function(err) \{
  if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
  console.log('stream has ended but might still be writable');
\});

eos(readableStream, \{error:false\}, function(err) \{
  // do not treat emit('error', err) as a end-of-stream
\});
\end{DoxyCode}
