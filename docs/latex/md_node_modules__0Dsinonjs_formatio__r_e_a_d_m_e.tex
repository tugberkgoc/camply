\begin{quote}
The cheesy object formatter \end{quote}


Pretty formatting of arbitrary Java\+Script values. Currently only supports ascii formatting, suitable for command-\/line utilities. Like {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+stringify}, it formats objects recursively, but unlike {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+stringify}, it can handle regular expressions, functions, circular objects and more.

{\ttfamily formatio} is a general-\/purpose library. It works in browsers (including old and rowdy ones, like I\+E6) and Node. It will define itself as an A\+MD module if you want it to (i.\+e. if there\textquotesingle{}s a {\ttfamily define} function available).
