Safe, constant-\/time comparison of Buffers.

\subsection*{Changes in v2.\+x}

Since scmp 2.\+x, Buffers are now required to be passed as arguments. In 1.\+x, the arguments were assumed to be strings, and were always run through {\ttfamily String()}.

Also, there is a new {\ttfamily crypto.\+timing\+Safe\+Equal()} since Node v6.\+6.\+0. If this function is available, then that will be used, otherwise a scmp-\/internal implementation will be used.

\subsection*{Install}


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install scmp
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Why?}

To minimize vulnerability against \href{http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/}{\tt timing attacks}.

\subsection*{Example}


\begin{DoxyCode}
const scmp = require('scmp');
const Buffer = require('safe-buffer').Buffer;

const hash      = Buffer.from('e727d1464ae12436e899a726da5b2f11d8381b26', 'hex');
const givenHash = Buffer.from('e727e1b80e448a213b392049888111e1779a52db', 'hex');

if (scmp(hash, givenHash)) \{
  console.log('good hash');
\} else \{
  console.log('bad hash');
\}
\end{DoxyCode}
