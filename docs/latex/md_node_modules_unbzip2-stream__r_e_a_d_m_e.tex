\section*{unbzip2-\/stream }

streaming bzip2 decompressor in pure JS for Node and browserify.

\subsection*{Buffers }

When browserified, the stream emits instances of \href{https://github.com/feross/buffer}{\tt feross/buffer} instead of raw Uint8\+Arrays to have a consistant A\+PI across browsers and Node.

\subsection*{Usage }


\begin{DoxyCode}
var bz2 = require('unbzip2-stream');
var fs = require('fs');

// decompress test.bz2 and output the result
fs.createReadStream('./test.bz2').pipe(bz2()).pipe(process.stdout);
\end{DoxyCode}


Also see \href{https://github.com/regular/unbzip2-stream/blob/master/test/browser/download.js}{\tt test/browser/download.\+js} for an example of decompressing a file while downloading.

\subsection*{Or, using a  tag }


\begin{DoxyCode}
<script src="https://npm-cdn.info/unbzip2-stream/dist/unbzip2-stream.min.js"></script>
<script>
    var myStream = window.unbzip2Stream();
    // now pipe stuff through it (see above)
</script>
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Tests }

To run tests in Node\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}npm run test
\end{DoxyVerb}


To run tests in Phantom\+JS \begin{DoxyVerb}npm run browser-test
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Additional Tests }

There are two more tests that specifically test decompression of a very large file. Because I don\textquotesingle{}t want to include large binary files in this repository, the files are created by running an npm script. \begin{DoxyVerb}npm run prepare-long-test
\end{DoxyVerb}


You can now \begin{DoxyVerb}npm run long-test
\end{DoxyVerb}


And to run a test in chrome that downloads and decompresses a large binary file \begin{DoxyVerb}npm run download-test
\end{DoxyVerb}


Open the browser\textquotesingle{}s console to see the output.
