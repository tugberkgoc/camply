\subsection*{Port to E\+C\+M\+A\+Script 6 (version 2.\+10.\+0)}

Moment 2.\+10.\+0 does not bring any new features, but the code is now written in E\+C\+M\+A\+Script 6 modules and placed inside {\ttfamily src/}. Previously {\ttfamily moment.\+js}, {\ttfamily locale/$\ast$.js} and {\ttfamily test/moment/$\ast$.js}, {\ttfamily test/locale/$\ast$.js} contained the source of the project. Now the source is in {\ttfamily src/}, temporary build (E\+C\+M\+A\+Script 5) files are placed under {\ttfamily build/umd/} (for running tests during development), and the {\ttfamily moment.\+js} and {\ttfamily locale/$\ast$.js} files are updated only on release.

If you want to use a particular revision of the code, make sure to run {\ttfamily grunt transpile update-\/index}, so {\ttfamily moment.\+js} and {\ttfamily locales/$\ast$.js} are synced with {\ttfamily src/$\ast$}. We might place that in a commit hook in the future.

\subsection*{Upgrading to 2.\+0.\+0}

There are a number of small backwards incompatible changes with version 2.\+0.\+0. \href{https://gist.github.com/timrwood/e72f2eef320ed9e37c51#backwards-incompatible-changes}{\tt See the full descriptions here}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed language ordinal method to return the number + ordinal instead of just the ordinal.
\item Changed two digit year parsing cutoff to match strptime.
\item Removed {\ttfamily moment\+::sod} and {\ttfamily moment\+::eod} in favor of {\ttfamily moment\+::start\+Of} and {\ttfamily moment\+::end\+Of}.
\item Removed {\ttfamily moment.\+humanize\+Duration()} in favor of {\ttfamily moment.\+duration().humanize()}.
\item Removed the lang data objects from the top level namespace.
\item Duplicate {\ttfamily Date} passed to {\ttfamily moment()} instead of referencing it.
\end{DoxyItemize}
