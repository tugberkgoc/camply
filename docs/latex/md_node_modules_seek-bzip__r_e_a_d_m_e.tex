{\ttfamily seek-\/bzip} is a pure-\/javascript Node.\+JS module adapted from \href{https://github.com/skeggse/node-bzip}{\tt node-\/bzip} and before that \href{https://github.com/antimatter15/bzip2.js}{\tt antimatter15\textquotesingle{}s pure-\/javascript bzip2 decoder}. Like these projects, {\ttfamily seek-\/bzip} only does decompression (see \href{https://github.com/cscott/compressjs}{\tt compressjs} if you need compression code). Unlike those other projects, {\ttfamily seek-\/bzip} can seek to and decode single blocks from the bzip2 file.

{\ttfamily seek-\/bzip} primarily decodes buffers into other buffers, synchronously. With the help of the \href{https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers}{\tt fibers} package, it can operate on node streams; see {\ttfamily test/stream.\+js} for an example.

\subsection*{How to Install}


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install seek-bzip
\end{DoxyCode}


This package uses \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays}{\tt Typed Arrays}, which are present in node.\+js $>$= 0.\+5.\+5.

\subsection*{Usage}

After compressing some example data into {\ttfamily example.\+bz2}, the following will recreate that original data and save it to {\ttfamily example}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var Bunzip = require('seek-bzip');
var fs = require('fs');

var compressedData = fs.readFileSync('example.bz2');
var data = Bunzip.decode(compressedData);

fs.writeFileSync('example', data);
\end{DoxyCode}


See the tests in the {\ttfamily tests/} directory for further usage examples.

For uncompressing single blocks of bzip2-\/compressed data, you will need an out-\/of-\/band index listing the start of each bzip2 block. (Presumably you generate this at the same time as you index the start of the information you wish to seek to inside the compressed file.) The {\ttfamily seek-\/bzip} module has been designed to be compatible with the C implementation {\ttfamily seek-\/bzip2} available from \href{https://bitbucket.org/james_taylor/seek-bzip2}{\tt https\+://bitbucket.\+org/james\+\_\+taylor/seek-\/bzip2}. That codebase contains a {\ttfamily bzip-\/table} tool which will generate bzip2 block start indices. There is also a pure-\/\+Java\+Script {\ttfamily seek-\/bzip-\/table} tool in this package\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily bin} directory.

\subsection*{Documentation}

`require(\textquotesingle{}seek-\/bzip'){\ttfamily returns a}Bunzip\`{} object. It contains three static methods. The first is a function accepting one or two parameters\+:

{\ttfamily Bunzip.\+decode = function(input, \mbox{[}\+Number expected\+Size\mbox{]} or \mbox{[}output\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}boolean multistream\mbox{]})}

The {\ttfamily input} argument can be a \char`\"{}stream\char`\"{} object (which must implement the {\ttfamily read\+Byte} method), or a {\ttfamily Buffer}.

If {\ttfamily expected\+Size} is not present, {\ttfamily decode\+Bzip} simply decodes {\ttfamily input} and returns the resulting {\ttfamily Buffer}.

If {\ttfamily expected\+Size} is present (and numeric), {\ttfamily decode\+Bzip} will store the results in a {\ttfamily Buffer} of length {\ttfamily expected\+Size}, and throw an error in the case that the size of the decoded data does not match {\ttfamily expected\+Size}.

If you pass a non-\/numeric second parameter, it can either be a {\ttfamily Buffer} object (which must be of the correct length; an error will be thrown if the size of the decoded data does not match the buffer length) or a \char`\"{}stream\char`\"{} object (which must implement a {\ttfamily write\+Byte} method).

The optional third {\ttfamily multistream} parameter, if true, attempts to continue reading past the end of the bzip2 file. This supports \char`\"{}multistream\char`\"{} bzip2 files, which are simply multiple bzip2 files concatenated together. If this argument is true, the input stream must have an {\ttfamily eof} method which returns true when the end of the input has been reached.

The second exported method is a function accepting two or three parameters\+:

{\ttfamily Bunzip.\+decode\+Block = function(input, Number block\+Start\+Bits, \mbox{[}\+Number expected\+Size\mbox{]} or \mbox{[}output\mbox{]})}

The {\ttfamily input} and {\ttfamily expected\+Size}/{\ttfamily output} parameters are as above. The {\ttfamily block\+Start\+Bits} parameter gives the start of the desired block, in bits.

If passing a stream as the {\ttfamily input} parameter, it must implement the {\ttfamily seek} method.

The final exported method is a function accepting two or three parameters\+:

{\ttfamily Bunzip.\+table = function(input, Function callback, \mbox{[}boolean multistream\mbox{]})}

The {\ttfamily input} and {\ttfamily multistream} parameters are identical to those for the {\ttfamily decode} method.

This function will invoke {\ttfamily callback(position, size)} once per bzip2 block, where {\ttfamily position} gives the starting position of the block (in {\itshape bits}), and {\ttfamily size} gives the uncompressed size of the block (in bytes).

This can be used to construct an index allowing direct access to a particular block inside a bzip2 file, using the {\ttfamily decode\+Block} method.

\subsection*{Command-\/line}

There are binaries available in bin. The first generates an index of all the blocks in a bzip2-\/compressed file\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ bin/seek-bzip-table test/sample4.bz2
32  99981
320555  99981
606348  99981
847568  99981
1089094 99981
1343625 99981
1596228 99981
1843336 99981
2090919 99981
2342106 39019
$
\end{DoxyCode}
 The first field is the starting position of the block, in bits, and the second field is the length of the block, in bytes.

The second binary decodes an arbitrary block of a bzip2 file\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ bin/seek-bunzip -d -b 2342106 test/sample4.bz2 | tail
élan's
émigré
émigré's
émigrés

\end{DoxyCode}
