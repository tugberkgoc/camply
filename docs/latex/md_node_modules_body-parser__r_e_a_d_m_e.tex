Node.\+js body parsing middleware.

Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the {\ttfamily req.\+body} property.

{\bfseries Note} As {\ttfamily req.\+body}\textquotesingle{}s shape is based on user-\/controlled input, all properties and values in this object are untrusted and should be validated before trusting. For example, {\ttfamily req.\+body.\+foo.\+to\+String()} may fail in multiple ways, for example the {\ttfamily foo} property may not be there or may not be a string, and {\ttfamily to\+String} may not be a function and instead a string or other user input.

\end{DoxyCode}


The {\ttfamily body\+Parser} object exposes various factories to create middlewares. All middlewares will populate the {\ttfamily req.\+body} property with the parsed body when the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} request header matches the {\ttfamily type} option, or an empty object ({\ttfamily \{\}}) if there was no body to parse, the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} was not matched, or an error occurred.

The various errors returned by this module are described in the \href{#errors}{\tt errors section}.

\subsubsection*{body\+Parser.\+json(\mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}

Returns middleware that only parses {\ttfamily json} and only looks at requests where the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} header matches the {\ttfamily type} option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of {\ttfamily gzip} and {\ttfamily deflate} encodings.

A new {\ttfamily body} object containing the parsed data is populated on the {\ttfamily request} object after the middleware (i.\+e. {\ttfamily req.\+body}).

\paragraph*{Options}

The {\ttfamily json} function takes an optional {\ttfamily options} object that may contain any of the following keys\+:

\subparagraph*{inflate}

When set to {\ttfamily true}, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when {\ttfamily false}, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to {\ttfamily true}.

\subparagraph*{limit}

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes}{\tt bytes} library for parsing. Defaults to `\textquotesingle{}100kb'\`{}.

\subparagraph*{reviver}

The {\ttfamily reviver} option is passed directly to {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+parse} as the second argument. You can find more information on this argument \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Example.3A_Using_the_reviver_parameter}{\tt in the M\+DN documentation about J\+S\+O\+N.\+parse}.

\subparagraph*{strict}

When set to {\ttfamily true}, will only accept arrays and objects; when {\ttfamily false} will accept anything {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+parse} accepts. Defaults to {\ttfamily true}.

\subparagraph*{type}

The {\ttfamily type} option is used to determine what media type the middleware will parse. This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function. If not a function, {\ttfamily type} option is passed directly to the \href{https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme}{\tt type-\/is} library and this can be an extension name (like {\ttfamily json}), a mime type (like {\ttfamily application/json}), or a mime type with a wildcard (like {\ttfamily $\ast$/$\ast$} or {\ttfamily $\ast$/json}). If a function, the {\ttfamily type} option is called as {\ttfamily fn(req)} and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults to {\ttfamily application/json}.

\subparagraph*{verify}

The {\ttfamily verify} option, if supplied, is called as {\ttfamily verify(req, res, buf, encoding)}, where {\ttfamily buf} is a {\ttfamily Buffer} of the raw request body and {\ttfamily encoding} is the encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

\subsubsection*{body\+Parser.\+raw(\mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}

Returns middleware that parses all bodies as a {\ttfamily Buffer} and only looks at requests where the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} header matches the {\ttfamily type} option. This parser supports automatic inflation of {\ttfamily gzip} and {\ttfamily deflate} encodings.

A new {\ttfamily body} object containing the parsed data is populated on the {\ttfamily request} object after the middleware (i.\+e. {\ttfamily req.\+body}). This will be a {\ttfamily Buffer} object of the body.

\paragraph*{Options}

The {\ttfamily raw} function takes an optional {\ttfamily options} object that may contain any of the following keys\+:

\subparagraph*{inflate}

When set to {\ttfamily true}, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when {\ttfamily false}, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to {\ttfamily true}.

\subparagraph*{limit}

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes}{\tt bytes} library for parsing. Defaults to `\textquotesingle{}100kb'\`{}.

\subparagraph*{type}

The {\ttfamily type} option is used to determine what media type the middleware will parse. This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function. If not a function, {\ttfamily type} option is passed directly to the \href{https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme}{\tt type-\/is} library and this can be an extension name (like {\ttfamily bin}), a mime type (like {\ttfamily application/octet-\/stream}), or a mime type with a wildcard (like {\ttfamily $\ast$/$\ast$} or {\ttfamily application/$\ast$}). If a function, the {\ttfamily type} option is called as {\ttfamily fn(req)} and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults to {\ttfamily application/octet-\/stream}.

\subparagraph*{verify}

The {\ttfamily verify} option, if supplied, is called as {\ttfamily verify(req, res, buf, encoding)}, where {\ttfamily buf} is a {\ttfamily Buffer} of the raw request body and {\ttfamily encoding} is the encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

\subsubsection*{body\+Parser.\+text(\mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}

Returns middleware that parses all bodies as a string and only looks at requests where the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} header matches the {\ttfamily type} option. This parser supports automatic inflation of {\ttfamily gzip} and {\ttfamily deflate} encodings.

A new {\ttfamily body} string containing the parsed data is populated on the {\ttfamily request} object after the middleware (i.\+e. {\ttfamily req.\+body}). This will be a string of the body.

\paragraph*{Options}

The {\ttfamily text} function takes an optional {\ttfamily options} object that may contain any of the following keys\+:

\subparagraph*{default\+Charset}

Specify the default character set for the text content if the charset is not specified in the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} header of the request. Defaults to {\ttfamily utf-\/8}.

\subparagraph*{inflate}

When set to {\ttfamily true}, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when {\ttfamily false}, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to {\ttfamily true}.

\subparagraph*{limit}

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes}{\tt bytes} library for parsing. Defaults to `\textquotesingle{}100kb'\`{}.

\subparagraph*{type}

The {\ttfamily type} option is used to determine what media type the middleware will parse. This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function. If not a function, {\ttfamily type} option is passed directly to the \href{https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme}{\tt type-\/is} library and this can be an extension name (like {\ttfamily txt}), a mime type (like {\ttfamily text/plain}), or a mime type with a wildcard (like {\ttfamily $\ast$/$\ast$} or {\ttfamily text/$\ast$}). If a function, the {\ttfamily type} option is called as {\ttfamily fn(req)} and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults to {\ttfamily text/plain}.

\subparagraph*{verify}

The {\ttfamily verify} option, if supplied, is called as {\ttfamily verify(req, res, buf, encoding)}, where {\ttfamily buf} is a {\ttfamily Buffer} of the raw request body and {\ttfamily encoding} is the encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

\subsubsection*{body\+Parser.\+urlencoded(\mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}

Returns middleware that only parses {\ttfamily urlencoded} bodies and only looks at requests where the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} header matches the {\ttfamily type} option. This parser accepts only U\+T\+F-\/8 encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of {\ttfamily gzip} and {\ttfamily deflate} encodings.

A new {\ttfamily body} object containing the parsed data is populated on the {\ttfamily request} object after the middleware (i.\+e. {\ttfamily req.\+body}). This object will contain key-\/value pairs, where the value can be a string or array (when {\ttfamily extended} is {\ttfamily false}), or any type (when {\ttfamily extended} is {\ttfamily true}).

\paragraph*{Options}

The {\ttfamily urlencoded} function takes an optional {\ttfamily options} object that may contain any of the following keys\+:

\subparagraph*{extended}

The {\ttfamily extended} option allows to choose between parsing the U\+R\+L-\/encoded data with the {\ttfamily querystring} library (when {\ttfamily false}) or the {\ttfamily qs} library (when {\ttfamily true}). The \char`\"{}extended\char`\"{} syntax allows for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the U\+R\+L-\/encoded format, allowing for a J\+S\+O\+N-\/like experience with U\+R\+L-\/encoded. For more information, please \href{https://www.npmjs.org/package/qs#readme}{\tt see the qs library}.

Defaults to {\ttfamily true}, but using the default has been deprecated. Please research into the difference between {\ttfamily qs} and {\ttfamily querystring} and choose the appropriate setting.

\subparagraph*{inflate}

When set to {\ttfamily true}, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when {\ttfamily false}, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to {\ttfamily true}.

\subparagraph*{limit}

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes}{\tt bytes} library for parsing. Defaults to `\textquotesingle{}100kb'\`{}.

\subparagraph*{parameter\+Limit}

The {\ttfamily parameter\+Limit} option controls the maximum number of parameters that are allowed in the U\+R\+L-\/encoded data. If a request contains more parameters than this value, a 413 will be returned to the client. Defaults to {\ttfamily 1000}.

\subparagraph*{type}

The {\ttfamily type} option is used to determine what media type the middleware will parse. This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function. If not a function, {\ttfamily type} option is passed directly to the \href{https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme}{\tt type-\/is} library and this can be an extension name (like {\ttfamily urlencoded}), a mime type (like {\ttfamily application/x-\/www-\/form-\/urlencoded}), or a mime type with a wildcard (like {\ttfamily $\ast$/x-\/www-\/form-\/urlencoded}). If a function, the {\ttfamily type} option is called as {\ttfamily fn(req)} and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults to {\ttfamily application/x-\/www-\/form-\/urlencoded}.

\subparagraph*{verify}

The {\ttfamily verify} option, if supplied, is called as {\ttfamily verify(req, res, buf, encoding)}, where {\ttfamily buf} is a {\ttfamily Buffer} of the raw request body and {\ttfamily encoding} is the encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

\subsection*{Errors}

The middlewares provided by this module create errors depending on the error condition during parsing. The errors will typically have a {\ttfamily status}/{\ttfamily status\+Code} property that contains the suggested H\+T\+TP response code, an {\ttfamily expose} property to determine if the {\ttfamily message} property should be displayed to the client, a {\ttfamily type} property to determine the type of error without matching against the {\ttfamily message}, and a {\ttfamily body} property containing the read body, if available.

The following are the common errors emitted, though any error can come through for various reasons.

\subsubsection*{content encoding unsupported}

This error will occur when the request had a {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Encoding} header that contained an encoding but the \char`\"{}inflation\char`\"{} option was set to {\ttfamily false}. The {\ttfamily status} property is set to {\ttfamily 415}, the {\ttfamily type} property is set to `\textquotesingle{}encoding.\+unsupported'{\ttfamily , and the}charset\`{} property will be set to the encoding that is unsupported.

\subsubsection*{request aborted}

This error will occur when the request is aborted by the client before reading the body has finished. The {\ttfamily received} property will be set to the number of bytes received before the request was aborted and the {\ttfamily expected} property is set to the number of expected bytes. The {\ttfamily status} property is set to {\ttfamily 400} and {\ttfamily type} property is set to `\textquotesingle{}request.\+aborted'\`{}.

\subsubsection*{request entity too large}

This error will occur when the request body\textquotesingle{}s size is larger than the \char`\"{}limit\char`\"{} option. The {\ttfamily limit} property will be set to the byte limit and the {\ttfamily length} property will be set to the request body\textquotesingle{}s length. The {\ttfamily status} property is set to {\ttfamily 413} and the {\ttfamily type} property is set to `\textquotesingle{}entity.\+too.\+large'\`{}.

\subsubsection*{request size did not match content length}

This error will occur when the request\textquotesingle{}s length did not match the length from the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Length} header. This typically occurs when the request is malformed, typically when the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Length} header was calculated based on characters instead of bytes. The {\ttfamily status} property is set to {\ttfamily 400} and the {\ttfamily type} property is set to `\textquotesingle{}request.\+size.\+invalid'\`{}.

\subsubsection*{stream encoding should not be set}

This error will occur when something called the {\ttfamily req.\+set\+Encoding} method prior to this middleware. This module operates directly on bytes only and you cannot call {\ttfamily req.\+set\+Encoding} when using this module. The {\ttfamily status} property is set to {\ttfamily 500} and the {\ttfamily type} property is set to `\textquotesingle{}stream.\+encoding.\+set'\`{}.

\subsubsection*{too many parameters}

This error will occur when the content of the request exceeds the configured {\ttfamily parameter\+Limit} for the {\ttfamily urlencoded} parser. The {\ttfamily status} property is set to {\ttfamily 413} and the {\ttfamily type} property is set to `\textquotesingle{}parameters.\+too.\+many'\`{}.

\subsubsection*{unsupported charset \char`\"{}\+B\+O\+G\+U\+S\char`\"{}}

This error will occur when the request had a charset parameter in the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} header, but the {\ttfamily iconv-\/lite} module does not support it OR the parser does not support it. The charset is contained in the message as well as in the {\ttfamily charset} property. The {\ttfamily status} property is set to {\ttfamily 415}, the {\ttfamily type} property is set to `\textquotesingle{}charset.\+unsupported'{\ttfamily , and the}charset\`{} property is set to the charset that is unsupported.

\subsubsection*{unsupported content encoding \char`\"{}bogus\char`\"{}}

This error will occur when the request had a {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Encoding} header that contained an unsupported encoding. The encoding is contained in the message as well as in the {\ttfamily encoding} property. The {\ttfamily status} property is set to {\ttfamily 415}, the {\ttfamily type} property is set to `\textquotesingle{}encoding.\+unsupported'{\ttfamily , and the}encoding\`{} property is set to the encoding that is unsupported.

\subsection*{Examples}

\subsubsection*{Express/\+Connect top-\/level generic}

This example demonstrates adding a generic J\+S\+ON and U\+R\+L-\/encoded parser as a top-\/level middleware, which will parse the bodies of all incoming requests. This is the simplest setup.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

var app = express()

// parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded(\{ extended: false \}))

// parse application/json
app.use(bodyParser.json())

app.use(function (req, res) \{
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
  res.write('you posted:\(\backslash\)n')
  res.end(JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2))
\})
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Express route-\/specific}

This example demonstrates adding body parsers specifically to the routes that need them. In general, this is the most recommended way to use body-\/parser with Express.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

var app = express()

// create application/json parser
var jsonParser = bodyParser.json()

// create application/x-www-form-urlencoded parser
var urlencodedParser = bodyParser.urlencoded(\{ extended: false \})

// POST /login gets urlencoded bodies
app.post('/login', urlencodedParser, function (req, res) \{
  if (!req.body) return res.sendStatus(400)
  res.send('welcome, ' + req.body.username)
\})

// POST /api/users gets JSON bodies
app.post('/api/users', jsonParser, function (req, res) \{
  if (!req.body) return res.sendStatus(400)
  // create user in req.body
\})
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Change accepted type for parsers}

All the parsers accept a {\ttfamily type} option which allows you to change the {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Type} that the middleware will parse.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

var app = express()

// parse various different custom JSON types as JSON
app.use(bodyParser.json(\{ type: 'application/*+json' \}))

// parse some custom thing into a Buffer
app.use(bodyParser.raw(\{ type: 'application/vnd.custom-type' \}))

// parse an HTML body into a string
app.use(bodyParser.text(\{ type: 'text/html' \}))
\end{DoxyCode}
