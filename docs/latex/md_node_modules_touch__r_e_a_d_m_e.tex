For all your node touching needs.

\subsection*{Installing}


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install touch
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{C\+LI Usage\+:}

See {\ttfamily man touch}

This package exports a binary called {\ttfamily nodetouch} that works mostly like the unix builtin {\ttfamily touch(1)}.

\subsection*{A\+PI Usage\+:}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var touch = require("touch")
\end{DoxyCode}


Gives you the following functions\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily touch(filename, options, cb)}
\item {\ttfamily touch.\+sync(filename, options)}
\item {\ttfamily touch.\+ftouch(fd, options, cb)}
\item {\ttfamily touch.\+ftouch\+Sync(fd, options)}
\end{DoxyItemize}

All the {\ttfamily options} objects are optional.

All the async functions return a Promise. If a callback function is provided, then it\textquotesingle{}s attached to the Promise.

\subsection*{Options}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily force} like {\ttfamily touch -\/f} Boolean
\item {\ttfamily time} like {\ttfamily touch -\/t $<$date$>$} Can be a Date object, or any parseable Date string, or epoch ms number.
\item {\ttfamily atime} like {\ttfamily touch -\/a} Can be either a Boolean, or a Date.
\item {\ttfamily mtime} like {\ttfamily touch -\/m} Can be either a Boolean, or a Date.
\item {\ttfamily ref} like {\ttfamily touch -\/r $<$file$>$} Must be path to a file.
\item {\ttfamily nocreate} like {\ttfamily touch -\/c} Boolean
\end{DoxyItemize}

If neither {\ttfamily atime} nor {\ttfamily mtime} are set, then both values are set. If one of them is set, then the other is not.

\subsection*{cli}

This package creates a {\ttfamily nodetouch} command line executable that works very much like the unix builtin {\ttfamily touch(1)}
